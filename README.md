## More information about the bug and how this Extension works:

There is a Youtube bug going on which is responsible for making the date of youtube videos does not show up as it was intended to do.

Depending on browser and monitor resolution, the publication date is not going to show up.

Basically, everyone can solve that bug without a extension, all you need to do is to zoom out the page to 80% or 70% in your browser [`CTRL + Mouse Wheel UP`]. 

TeamYoutube pronunciated themselves by saying that they already fixed it on **9/26/19** (https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/13826560?hl=en), but **that story is not true**.

Here's an screenshot I took on **10/29/19:**

The date clearly does not show up.

When the browser is zoomed out to 80%, then the date appears:

A lot of people is relating the same problem in every part of the internet [`FOR EXAMPLE: https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/d25pl1/bug_youtube_removed_upload_date/`].

The easiest way to solve this headache is to change the publication date position in the page layout whenever *any* Youtube video page is loaded:

Zoomed out, same effect:

**That's what this extesion does.**
