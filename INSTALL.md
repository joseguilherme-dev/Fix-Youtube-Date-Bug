# In order to install it on Chrome:
This extension is not published yet at Chrome Web Store.

Hence, there is no way to download it from there or download some .crx file inside this repository.

The **only way to use this chrome extension** is to [download](https://github.com/joseguilhermefmoura/Fix-Youtube-Date-Bug/archive/master.zip) it's repository content and then installing it manually this way:


 1. Unzip the file and localize the folder named "Fix-Youtube-Date-Bug" inside "Fix-Youtube-Date-Bug-master".
 2. Click the Chrome menu icon     ![](https://developer.chrome.com/static/images/hotdogmenu.png) and select **Extensions** from the **Tools** menu. Ensure that the "Developer mode" checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
 3. Drag the folder you've localized before "Fix-Youtube-Date-Bug" to the page and it will be added to your browser successfully and **should now be working**.
 4. You can optionally hide it from the menu later.

Enjoy.
